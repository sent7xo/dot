# dot
just my dotfiles.

## nvim
i wanted to use fuzzy finder, but for some reason i always need to tap <ESC> or <C-C> twice to close it. so i use ctrlp instead. i don't think it's that big of a deal (for now?).

## mycmd & scripts
mycmd is a cmd shortcut with proggysquarettsz font and a monokai theme ripped from cmder. it runs initcmd.bat on start.
scripts folder has initcmd.bat which sets the prompt to be similar with cmder and run doskeys, build\_template.bat for cpp projects, and mpv-audio.bat to listen to audio-only ytdl mpv.
